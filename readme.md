### Verify python is installed

To open Command Prompt -

*   Press Win + R, type "cmd", and hit Enter. A black window will appear.

Then type

python --version  
pip --version

If they are not installed (if either of them gives you anything other than a version number)

*   Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
*   Download the latest version for Windows.
*   Run the installer with these options:
    *   Check "Add Python to PATH"
    *   Click "Install Now"

### Download the scripts

Right click on the two links below and "Save link as" and save the files to your Desktop folder  
(you can save it anywhere else, but in the steps below you'll need to cd to that folder instead - if you don't know what that means, keep it on your Desktop :)

*   [requirements.txt](https://mcohen3.com/cricut/requirements.txt)
*   [resetcricut.py](http://mcohen3.com/cricut/resetcricut.py)

### Run it

Open Command Prompt again

*   Press Win + R, type "cmd", and hit Enter. A black window will appear.

Type

cd Desktop  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python resetcricut.py

If Cricut launches congratulations! You're finished! P.S. Don't delete these files

Every time after that you should be able to double click on "resetcricut.py". If it asks how you want to open it, select python and check the "always use this option" checkbox
